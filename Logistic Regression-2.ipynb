    "\n",
    "# Ans:\n",
    "\n",
    "# The purpose of Grid Search Cross-Validation (GridSearchCV) in machine learning is to systematically search\n",
    "# through a predefined hyperparameter space for the best combination of hyperparameters for a given model. \n",
    "\n",
    "# How does Grid Search CV work?\n",
    "\n",
    "# Define the Hyperparameter Grid: We specify a dictionary or a list of possible values for each \n",
    "# hyperparameter we want to tune. This creates a \"grid\" of all possible hyperparameter combinations.   \n",
    "\n",
    "# Cross-Validation: For each combination of hyperparameters in the grid, GridSearchCV performs k-fold \n",
    "# cross-validation. This means the training data is split into k equal-sized folds. The model is trained \n",
    "# on k-1 folds and evaluated on the remaining fold. This process is repeated k times, with each fold serving \n",
    "# as the validation set once. The performance metric (e.g., accuracy, F1-score, AUC) is averaged across the \n",
    "# k folds to get an estimate of the model's performance for that specific hyperparameter combination.   \n",
    "\n",
    "# Search and Evaluation: GridSearchCV systematically iterates through every hyperparameter combination in \n",
    "# the grid. For each combination, it performs the cross-validation as described above and records the average \n",
    "# performance score.   \n",
    "\n",
    "# Best Model Selection: After evaluating all hyperparameter combinations, GridSearchCV identifies the combination \n",
    "# that yielded the best performance score (according to the chosen metric). It then trains the model on the entire \n",
